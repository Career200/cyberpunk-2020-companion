        <p><br><br> <b>Special ability: <i>Combat Sense</i></b><br>  Added to all <i>Initiative</i> and <i>Awareness</i> checks, this makes the Solo the fastest reacting perso in a situation<br><br>

        Netrunners are most often very young, but they move in the Cyberspace better than computer science professors - because they are born into it. They learned the strings of World Wide Web as we learned names of the streets in our block.

        <p><br><br> <b>Special ability: <i>Jury Rig</i></b><br>This general repair skill allows the Techie to temporarily repair or alter anything for 1D6 turns per level of skill<br><br>

        <i><blockquote>So get this... This metalhead breaks down the door, shoves my patient off the table and lies down. Massive gun in one hand, bag with fat stacks in the other, and bleeding profusely. Seemed tough, but... His implants alone bought me rent for two months</blockquote></i>
        <figcaption>- Skelly Jones, Ripperdoc</figcaption>
        <p><br><br> <b>Special ability: <i>Medical Tech</i></b><br>This is the skill used to perform major surjery and medical repairs<br><br>
        When booster gangs happen to flatline a cybered-up gonk, they often rush the body to a Ripperdoc. They dismantle the poor guy (or gal) and pay the ganger generously. Ripperdocs that have some morals and prefer his patients alive are called Medtechs and work in hospitals, implant clinics and often - directly with mercenaries, as combat medics. Of course, there is also a matter of Trauma Team - the most professional - and costly - lifesaving service in NC... Choose this class if you want to be Solo's best friend, know your way around a wound and love fitting new cybertech in those who pay<br><br>

        <p><br><br> <b>Special ability: <i>Authority</i></b><br>The ability to intimidate or control others through your position as a lawman<br><br>
        A cop's a cop. What else to say...

        <h2>Fixers</h2>
        <i><blockquote>You make a friend - he'll take you in when the street's too hat, and they'll pass you a bit of datat when you call in the markers. But that's business. I got a slogan..."How much you pay me?"</blockquote></i>
        <figcaption>- Phil "Nacho" Hernandez, Fixer</figcaption>
        <p><br><br> <b>Special ability: <i>Streetdeal</i></b><br>The ability to locate people, information, etc. This is a higher form of <i>making a connection</i>; instead of knowing only one person, you have connections everywhere. In gameplay, a successful use of Streetdeal allows you to locate and acquire a desired person, place or thing<br><br>
        Fixers are the blood of the streets, and stability (like in homeostasis) is a Fixers worst enemy - once the chaos is gone, his services are of no need to his clientele. Clients won't pay if they're dead, though... so a successful Fixers maintains a propper balance of danger and safety, heat and safehouses, supply and demand. Choose this class if you are capable of doing bad things for the sake of a bigger good, understand gang wars beyond "these are bad people" and can get away with anything<br><br>

        <p><br><br> <b>Special ability: <i>Family</i></b><br>This allows Nomad to call in as many Family members to aid him as his current <i>Family Ability</i> level x2 <br><br>
        The Wildlands are surprisingly full of life. What seems like an empty, windy desert to the unknowing eye, for a Nomad is a story - the Mono hums to the north, fresh tyre tracks say raiders near, and that one jackrabbit in the dirt means a good stew for the family. The city is no different - ifnwhen a Nomad comes to town, the town trembles. It may have something to do with big cam Cummins motor in every third Caravan car running right outside the town, but the effect still stands. Choose this class if you'd rather die than give up your freedom, van life is perfect for you, and your soul is the stone your principles are carved in<br><br>

        <h2>Custom classes</h2>
        <p>You can create custom classes too, but first - think, do you really need to? Why and how any of existing classes don't fit your character? Are you going to create a new Special Ability, or only modify the Career Skills to better reflect your characters goals, features and upbringing?<br><br>
        Once you're dead set on creating a new class - pick any 9 skills to be your Career Skills - but remember, that they directly reflect the career your character follows, be reasonable and talk to your Ref. And coming up with a brand new Special Ability - your Ref has to approve it and/or help you with it</p>
