This is a tool for players and Referees to track character and world info, roll dice, and much more

The upcoming features/TODO list:

1. Several pages, deployed: main, maps with Night City, New United States, parts of Europe and more, character sheets as a printable image, classes overview, lifepath generation scheme, filled character sheets for disposable gonks: DONE! Except for the disposables, but that'd be ready with the interactive character sheets
2. Integrated dice widget: DONE! And I gotta say I enjoyed making it. TODO: highlight the crits
3. Night City map based on leaflet.js with advanced features
4. Interactive character sheet
5. Interactive lifepath generator: In progress, paused
6. Gear list - Cyber, guns, armor, special equipment and vehicles (can take a form of a shopping cart maybe): Has scans, sometime in the far future will be a real online shop (simulated)
7. Worldbuilding/inspirational content, original stories(possibly)
8. Down- and uploadable JSON with character info for the interactive charSheet (probably not anytime soon)
